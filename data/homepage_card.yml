    The project this year has focused on combating the antiquated tests currently in place for diseases linked to women’s health.
    Our method involves multiplexed regulation which uses four stacked toehold switches, for the four diseases, which each test for three miRNA.
    The switches incorporate genetic 'AND' gates, allowing for high specificity.
    Uniquely, our project allows for the miRNA binding sites to be swapped meaning various diseases can be tested for, using the database we have compiled.

    Our project's software component is designed to empower iGEM teams by offering a seamless way of applying our modular toehold switch designs to a plethora of situations.
    Our goal is to ensure maximum efficiency and user-friendliness, achieved through comprehensive integration with widely used and accepted standards in bioinformatics and synthetic biology.
    This enables teams to effortlessly implement our innovative designs in any desired context.

    In Project Genoswitch, the Hardware team has mainly focused on creating effective extraction and testing tools that are cheap, efficient and easy to use.
    Our primary method of extraction involves using magnetic nanoparticles and biotin-streptavidin in order to seperate miRNA from a medium, which can then be followed by RPA and miRPA for proper amplification.
    In order to create a robust testing system, we designed a custom luminometer that improves upon the designs of previous City iGEM teams by using multiple LDRs to allow for the simultaneous detection of several toehold switches, as well as integrating WebUSB to allow for easier interfacing with client-side devices.

    Using synthetic biology has great potential for a positive impact, however it can easily become irresponsible and not bring real benefits for society.
    Human practices therefore hold the responsibility to think deeply and creatively about whether our project is truly beneficial. Through gathering input from professionals in the field such as gynaecologists and pioneers in the field of synthetic biology, we can ensure that our project design is informed and has a real impact.
    Carrying out surveys provided us with information from the general public, helping us gauge how much is known about the treatment and symptoms of these diseases. All of our research means we can have a better view of the problem at hand and can create a product that is better suited to tackle it.
    Human practices is not a specific activity, but we will aim to engage, educate, and inform the wider community of our intentions.

    Modelling is integral to the smooth running of Project Genoswitch.
    Through these calculations, we are able to make better informed decisions across all areas of the project, testing many potential solutions in order to find the ones that work and optimise them.
    Computational modelling also offers an opportunity to take the theoretical science and see how it can be applied to the problems at hand.
    The Modelling team works on building simulations and doing calculations in order to better understand how the project fits together, while also constantly looking at how it can be improved.
