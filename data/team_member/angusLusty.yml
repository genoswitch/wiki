description: "Angus discovered an early love of science when he first found that cress does indeed germinate in a dark cupboard. Other recent successes have included a homemade, lockdown dissection of a lambâ€™s heart, making his own yoghurt (which got better when he remembered to put the seal on), and wildly oversized scones. In more lab-based environments, he discovered the smell of burnt eyebrows, blazers, and probably some other stuff."
