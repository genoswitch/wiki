description: "Much like all the avid Year 12 members of the team, Anushri is committed to putting her all in this team. Riveted by the fascinating world of synthetic biology and genetic engineering, Anushri also thoroughly enjoys the hardware and engineering aspect of the project. The Fifth Form project on oestrogen has really taken Anushri by interest, with its niche aspects as well as numerous opportunities to learn and develop further. The collaborative environment of iGEM is a comfort for her as well as it allows her to exchange insights with peers and broaden her perspectives. If the experience of iGEM so far has taught her anything - it's that she's going to love it."
