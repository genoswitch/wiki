description: "Who would've thought that Astrid's cross country running would help us take leaps in our project. From running with a box of e.coli so it stayed cold at -80°C for our lab work, to being on team calls until 11pm - her commitment to the project is clear. A natural team leader, Astrid keeps the mood light even late on a Monday evening with endless jokes about being taller than 90% of the boys on the team. Keeping everyone on track and finding creative solutions to complicated problems with the biology of the project, we don’t know where we would be without her."
