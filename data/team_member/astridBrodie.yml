description: "Who would've thought that Astrid's newfound love of running would actually have come in useful, from running to the labs in the (misguided) hope of being on time, to running boxes of equipment across London dressed as the next James Bond. Her work in the labs has been pivotal, especially through incubating our bacteria (shaken, not stirred). Her commitment to the project knows no limit, although nothing could ever top the Instagram account that she set up for her dog. Having worked on Genoswitch since the beginning, she is well versed and keeps everything on a tight leash, except her equipment which she manages to consistently under order. Astrid owes all her success to the wondeful lab techs who have stepped in to make the projectÂ possible."
