description: "Although not being able to participate in quite as many labs as she would have liked (zero), Augustine is a lively member of the biology team. She enjoys all aspects of her role in the team, and hopes to use the skills she has acquired doing iGEM in her chemistry degree and beyond. Still grieving the initial project that she was working on, she has found ways to continue using her effective research skills that she had acquired at the time. Being in the biology team has been a fantastic opportunity to discover new aspects of the subject that Augustine had not been able to explore in class (she had been able to explore them at the university of Chicago last year)."
