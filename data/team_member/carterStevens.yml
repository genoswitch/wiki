description: "While he is the head of modelling, Carter's ability to run an interesting discourse on many intellectual topics ranging from Quantum and Number theory to the efficacy of spaceflight or just plain old Star Wars is an impressive sight to behold. However his attempts to introduce pantera to a wider audience have not been so successful (what even is a pantera?). Although his hand-written mathematical hieroglyphs may be indecipherable to the uninitiated, the now-iconic yellow paper on which he presents his findings has become a symbol for the academic excellence towards which every member of City iGEM strives."
