  David has dedicated his heart and soul to the success of Genoswitch ever since the failure of his valiant attempt to culture a project aiming to cure phenylketonuria. 'Phenylkure', his brainchild (named with the finesse of a portmanteau-crazed geneticist who moonlights as a stand-up comedian), had a logo designed by Rishabh which stole David's heart, although at times it seemed that he liked that logo a bit too much. Unfortunately, Phenylkure was a _hard cell_ to our team leaders, however, it has not dissuaded David as he has proven that his knack for finding miRNA for our blood-based diagnostic tools truly runs in his DNA. His skills in the wetlab have also been A+, when he needs to _B. Cereus_. He can accomplish the task at hand with focus sharper than a restriction enzyme. Overall, it cannot be understated how much of a dopamine rush it has been to work with David - I shall halt my scribbles here, lest the biology puns become _cornea and cornea_ by the word.
