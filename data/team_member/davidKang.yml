description: "David Kang's life is dominated, to an almost obsessive degree, by the pursuit of order. Whether he is playing his oboe in harmony with the rest of the school orchestra, or marching in unison with the rest of the CCF, whether he is solving near-impossible BMO questions or streamlining his discourse to almost NPC-like levels of purity, David is always logical, always ordered, and (like his GCSE grades) always perfect.  Although this attitude may have taken its toll on his sense of humour, he is still a man (albeit a non-playable one) to be admired. David has bled, toiled, tore and sweated for the iGEM cause, working tirelessly and cheerfully to silently slip by whenever tasks are assigned to the hardware team."
