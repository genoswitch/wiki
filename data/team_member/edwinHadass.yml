description: "If you take a mad scientist and surgically drain away his personality, then you're only a coat of grey paint away from something approximating Edwin. Eddie is the co-head of hardware, a role he is primarily qualified for due to his ability to jump between different concepts and goals with ease, always ready to contribute somebody else's ideas to the project. Edwin's time at City has been as dazzling as his smile, with his biggest achievement being an appearance in the school's publicity campaign as a second former, playing table tennis with Louis. Insofar as he has passions, Edwin is passionate about changing the world for the better; the anti-manspreading chair he designed for art GCSE worked very well indeed, and his heroic efforts to make the microbial fuel cell he helped develop produce energy at only Â£50000 per Watt (only slightly more than British Gas) are nothing short of inspirational."
