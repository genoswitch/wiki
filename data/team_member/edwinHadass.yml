description: "You used to find Edwin creatively writing or reading sci-fi in his spare time, but the numbers won in their war with words, and now you'll find him working on another coding project. Nonetheless his experience in designing small video games in his spare time have resulted in an ability to come up with creative solutions to often challenging design problems. While his love for grunge may not have yet resulted in the inevitable beard longer than he is tall, he hopes that this year's project provides a good facelift to some tried and tested ideas."
