  "As our powerhouse of leadership, Emily exudes confidence and reliability. From biology to external connections she oversees all of the City of London iGEM team's workings, and ensures that this machine is always efficient and productive, much like her team on the football field. Whether it be telling the team off for not doing the work, or telling the team off for not communicating, Emily's always ready to step in when others won't."
