description: "As one of the few sane realists in the team, Harry never fails to steady the iGEM ship with his (mostly) calm and considered remarks. Neither abrasive nor stagnant, Harry keeps the project – and its members' morale – moving in the right direction. In his free time, he enjoys going for a run or getting stuck into a killer sudoku, with the occasional spot of politics if the opportunity presents itself. After iGEM (although once an iGEMmer, always an iGEMmer), Harry hopes to study Medicine, and put his newfound research skills to the test at medical school. We wish him all the best!"
