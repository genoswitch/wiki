description: "Being part of the biology team, Hester plays an essential role in the iGEM team, making sure the wheels keep turning even when things get a bit challenging, as they often do. From abruptly terminating research projects and making quick turn arounds, to doing repeat after repeat in the lab to achieve the required results, Hester has certainly developed her virtue of patience through iGEM. However, the skills Hester has learned and acquired through this experience have changed the way she works in a team and learns from others, and she aspires to use these important skills when studying a chemistry degree in the future."
