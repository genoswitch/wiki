description: "Alongside other diligent, dedicated individuals in the City of London iGEM team sharing an unwavering commitment to synthetic biology's transformative potential, Irene partook in research. The Year 12 team embarked on developing a probiotic that alleviates symptoms of menopause - which could revolutionise the lives of many women worldwide. This project has given her the freedom to peruse peer-reviewed journals, improve her ability to communicate complex ideas with clarity, and pursue a greater understanding of the human body. As an aspiring medic, Irene particularly enjoyed delving deeper into biochemical pathways, homeostatic mechanisms and intricate physiology that left her awestruck. She hopes to walk away with a greater insight into genetic engineering."
