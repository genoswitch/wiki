description:
  "James' role at CLS as 'unofficial IT support' for the past 6 years has paid dividends over time, resulting in him being one of the heads of hardware, and a leading member of the software team.
  His dedication is evident in his tireless efforts to design schematics for our luminometer and repeatedly amazing us with his seemingly limitless knowledge of coding while programming its firmware.
  On top of all that, he's been lending a helping hand to Rishabh with bits and pieces of the software, making him an absolute pleasure to work with. James is our team's secret weapon, and we're lucky to have him!"
