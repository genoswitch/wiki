description: "Eager to plunge into the depths of synthetic biology and develop her skills to leverage biology to engineer solutions to relevant, real life problems, ranging from healthcare to chemical synthesis, Lili joined the City of London iGEM team. Determined to pursue a career in medicine in the near future, this year’s Fifth Form oestrogen project has proved to be a perfect fit for her interests, and she has thoroughly enjoyed spending countless hours critically analysing peer-reviewed journals which often leave her incredibly curious and with more questions than answers…Throughout her experience so far, Lili has not only been able to stretch her intellectual horizons of the human body, but has also been gifted with the invaluable opportunity of improving her skills in collaborative ethical communication, ensuring that all members of the group have a solid, mutual understanding. Now that her interest has been piqued even further, Lili cannot wait to see what the future of iGEM holds."
