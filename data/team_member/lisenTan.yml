description: "Despite being the root cause of the greatest waste of time and effort the iGEM team faced, once it was clear that microbial fuel cells weren't capable of fuelling anything more than Edwin's anger towards the project, Li Sen quickly turned to join the modelling team. Though the maths was not nearly as pure as he would like, Li Sen made sure to spend his time wisely, devoting many hours to learning the multivariable calculus required to understand any of Carterâ€™s calculations. Li Sen has a variety of interests outside of the classroom, including but not limited to algebra, number theory, topology, Galois theory and Tetris. Through iGEM, Li Sen has gained an appreciation for the more applied sides of maths and science, and hopes to continue to develop his knowledge by studying maths at university."
