description: "It may be in her last name, but in real life Lola's no idler when it comes to detailed and diligent research. With roots in the ideas team providing necessary 'escape routes' in case all goes downhill, Lola has greatly enjoyed being a part of the iGEM Biology team, and is looking forward to witnessing its success. She's looking forward to adapting the skills picked up along the way in a chemistry degree post CLSG."
