description: "Louis can often be seen power-walking around CLSB, racing to complete a to-do-list that would make your eyes hurt, with an inbox fuller than his bag, whilst often assisting staff and pupils with their technological qualms and queries. Louis has been a valued member of our Human Practises Team this year. Alongside his twin brother James, and Rishabh, Louis has played a leading role in creating this year's team wiki. He also helped to create our two team videos, and assisted Anni with the social media campaign. He has a passion for biology, and a genuine interest in the personal and communicative areas of science, and very much wishes to study medicine in the future."
