description: "Although he is the Director of a General Hospital in Two-Point Hospital, Louis limits himself to the public relations side of the iGEM project, always keen to write a sufficiently waffly paragraph or two about any topic that is given to him. Some of his interests in the field include genetic engineering and the moral and ethical questions surrounding the wider adoption of biotechnology in society, and the potential ramifications this could have for our modern legal systems. Not only is this last sentence entirely true, it is also a perfect example of Louis' waffle-ability. He looks forward to continuing in this stead over the coming year!"
