description: "Throughout this years' iGEM effort, Matthew has been a crucial component of the biology team. He has a knack for finding obscure Yugoslavian research papers, a skill which has been put into good use in the research aspect of the biology team's efforts. When not absorbed in a paper, he is likely to be found staring at old pottery, whilst resolutely assuring anyone who will listen that Exekias is far superior to whomever else is suggested. He aims to go on to university to study a bioscience, and apply the skills learnt from his time in iGEM there."
