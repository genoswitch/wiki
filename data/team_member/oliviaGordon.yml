description: "What Livvy lacks in height, she makes up for with her biological ability. From detecting frameshift mutations, to discovering that many researched miRNAs are upregulated as a result of many diseases, there always seems to be a problem to be solved. Livvy's greatest achievement to date is probably naming the project, which despite her best efforts, is always pronounced wrong. Despite all of this, she has thoroughly enjoyed being a part of the iGEM team, with an aim to continue research projects in the future while studying medicine."
