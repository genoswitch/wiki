description: "Tobi is a reliable member of our biology team and has been a bit of a utility player filling in when random tasks need to be done. Whilst he may have more notable roles in school, such as being the Head Boy at CLS, and as a result has to deal with always being called 'THE' by Louis, his ever-smiling presence seems to have taken well to being a cog in our iGEM machine. Tobi plans to take use that he learns from iGEM in his future career in medicine."
