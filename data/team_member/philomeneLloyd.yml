description: "Philo is our fabulous co-head of Human Practices, without her we would have been stuck with nowhere to do our lab work and no money (which would have been slightly less than ideal). When she's not doing iGEM, she continues to live up to CLSG's three R's: respectfulness, resourcefulness and a ridiculous love of running (we’re still not sure why…). With Philo at the helm of human practices, our iGEM team has formed valuable connections with other teams and individuals, and has survived the highs and lows of our project."
