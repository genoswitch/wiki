description: "Despite the fact that Qifan hasn't been seen with a done-up top button at school for the past 3 years, even though the time and effort it would take him to do it would be 100x easier than writing this sentence, Qifan is always willing to complete any tasks that he is given in iGEM, irrespective of its complexity. Although he may have a clumsy appearance, he has an industrious work ethic in iGEM, and is always willing to learn more, and not many would be able to survive as many of Li Sen's hieroglyphic lectures on group theory with such poise as he did. His research into the luminometer was essential for our project's success, and he is hoping to take the lessons that he has learnt from iGEM to study maths at university."
