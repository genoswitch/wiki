description: "Rafael has been a student as CLS for over 5 years now, and biology has never ceased to be his absolute favourite subject to study. However, he also takes great interest in humanities, as demonstrated by his A Level choices of biology, maths, geography, and religion and philosophy. He is an avid player of tennis, and a co-chair of the CLS charity committee. So, when the opportunity to become a part of the City of London iGEM team came around, he jumped at the idea. The sheer rarity of the experience of being able to work in the field of genetic engineering coupled with an opportunity to solve real world problems excited him beyond anything. This year, he has gained valuable experience in the design aspect of our iGEM team, which he will use as a member of next year's team. He has a burning desire to learn more about biomedical sciences, and the good they can do for humanity and hopes to find this working as a member of the iGEM team."
