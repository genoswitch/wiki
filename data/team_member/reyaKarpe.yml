description:
  "Amongst the other assiduous year 12s, Reya joined this year's J6 team looking to expand her knowledge on biomedical sciences. Reya's passion for biomed stemmed from a young age when she discovered through the manipulation of four simple bases, one could alter someone's life for the better. From then on, her infatuation transformed into a keen ambition to utilise the building bricks of life to improve the state of millions. Attuning her interest through further research and internships, this ambition evolved into a keen desire to delve further into the complex nature of biomedical sciences.
  In Reya's current project, the team is attempting to theorise a pill that could regulate oestrogen levels in menopausal women. This revolutionary pill would only need to be taken once and develop into a self-sustaining system, working in tandem with the body to regulate oestrogen levels. Admittedly, biomedicine presents its own set of unique challenges. However, the fulfilment one carries knowing they can help thousands of people only serves to fuel Reya's motivation."
