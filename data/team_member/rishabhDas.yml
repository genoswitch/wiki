description: "Rishabh is our resident Prince of Puns and connoisseur of interesting icebreakers. His proficiency in tinkering with video games (resulting in him having more Skyrim mods than millimetres in height) have translated well into his quick wit, sharp pen, and aptitude for solving challenging problems. His ability to adopt sleek graphic styles and write efficient (albeit poorly documented) code have resulted in both breath-taking pieces of media and breakthroughs in the bio-software of our project, making him a truly invaluable asset to the team."
