description:
  "Where to start with Ryan? While I have never seen anyone do so much work for something they seem so dispassionate about, Ryan's contribution to iGEM has been invaluable, pioneering the project from the beginning. 
In the process of trying to be more like Julian Chen, he has achieved much in his time in iGEM. Following in the footsteps of who he believes to be the greatest leader of all time, Ryan has ruled CLS iGEM with an iron fist. He has told many lies: that he doesn't need a calculator, that he'd be 'happy' to help and that Luke Wallis's prediction wouldn't come true. 
Accidental flirting seems to come incredibly naturally to him, and the rest of the time he enjoys diplomatically scheming with Zac on the caf√© balcony like he's the best thing since sliced bread. Full Windsor's have never looked so dapper, but given our school uniform is not Tommy Hilfiger, the jury's still out over whether he's a fan. Ryan's music taste is archaic; from his love of the Dancing Queen to the band Queen, he refuses to move into the current century.
Outside of the classroom, Ryan watches Formula One religiously, and he's just hoping the colour of our iGEM medal this year is better than the participation one Mercedes will receive this season. We all feel so... blessed to be working with him!"
