description: "As Samaara is one of the few members of our team that is doing a humanities A Level, she has managed to land herself the role of writing and editing articles for the wiki. Her ability to translate the teamâ€™s sometimes indecipherable lab notes has meant that even the top members of Project Genoswitch have her to thank on the journey to Paris. No matter what she does, Samaara is always ready to further the learning of others, even being so gracious as to donate her Oestrogen regulation project to the next generation as a preparatory exercise. Truly an inspiration to the people."
