description: "Although Samaara does not do economics A level, nor has she ever shown an interest in anything vaguely related to the subject, she has somehow wrangled her way into the Human Practices team. Drafting some wiki articles and creating surveys, she has made a valuable contribution to our project. No matter what she does, Samaara is always ready to further the learning of others, even being so gracious and humble as to donate her Oestrogen regulation project to the next generation as a preparatoryÂ exercise."
