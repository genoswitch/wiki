description: "Matriculating over from iGEM team 2022, Sophie brings with her a natural affinity towards all things biology. She has enjoyed developing the initial ideas for the team, whilst simultaneously conquering levels in 'Gardenscapes'. Unfortunately, whilst a master gardener on screen, she struggles to touch grass in the real world - spending most of her time buried under the sheets (of scientific papers, that is)."
