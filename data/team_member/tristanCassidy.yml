description: "Now as you can see from his state of dress in this image, Tristan isn't known for his ability to tuck in his shirt, but rather for his attention to detail and cunning eye for improvements and solutions. He's always willing to pick up any task no matter its size in order to help the team out and increase his contribution to the team.  Alongside giving him a chance to explore his interests further, iGEM has forced him to improve his patience as he eagerly awaits for the hardware testing to start, with him passing the time with an unhealthy addiction to FM. Despite his addictions, once he learns that sleeves are meant to be buttoned and shirts tucked in, he will go far in whatever he chooses to do in the scientific fields or beyond."
