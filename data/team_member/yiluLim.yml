description: "Despite never making a single accurate shot whilst playing GTA V, Yilu's gaming ability is unparalleled. These skills are applicable to all aspects of co-leading our iGEM biology team, such as being able to retain her humility whilst answering questions she has no clue about. Her love of biology far surpasses all else, most notably her common sense when being told she's 'taking on too much work'."
