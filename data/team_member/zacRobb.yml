description: "With his glaring hatred of socialism and love for economies of scale, Zac has been steadfastly guiding City iGEMs economic progress.
He has embraced the maxim "work smarter not harder" alongside its key tenets of delegation, procrastination, weaselling his way out of events he organised himself. Combined with his admiration for Blairite economics, this has enabled Zac to run the tight ship necessary in the often tumultuous environment of an iGEM team."
