### Stock solutions for creating competent bacteria

1. LB medium 200 ml in 1L flask (2g Tryptone, 1g Yeast extract, 1g NaCl and H₂O to 200ml). Close with sponge and foil. Label, autoclave at 125°C for 15 minutes and store at room temperature.  
2. LB agar 2 x 50ml in 125ml flask: (500mg Tryptone, 250mg Yeast extract, 250mg NaCl, 750mg Agar and H₂O to 50ml). Close with sponge and foil. Label, autoclave at 125°C for 15 minutes and store at room temperature.  
3. 0.1 M MgCl2 solution (2.033 g of MgCl2·6H₂O in 100ml of H₂O) in 100ml Pyrex bottle. Autoclave and store at 4°C.
4. 0.1 M CaCl2 solution (11 g of CaCl2·6H₂O in 500 ml of H₂O) in 500ml Pyrex bottle. Autoclave and store at 4°C.
5. 50% glycerol solution (5ml of glycerol and 5ml H₂O in 20ml) culture tube with screw cup. Autoclave and store at 4°C.

### Pouring agar plates

Wipe down the bench/ working space with 70% Ethanol or bleach.  
1. Remove foil cover from LB agar flask but leave sponge.  
2. Melt LB agar in microwave and cool to 50°C.   
3. Remove 2 sterile Petri dishes from storage.  
4. Work under flame.  
5. (Optional). If antibiotic is required add solution to the LB agar and mix  
6. Pour a layer 25ml of LB agar into each plate, being careful to not lift the cover off excessively.  
7. Let each plate to set until its solid (~30 min) then flip so as to avoid condensation on the agar and leave for an additional 30 minutes.  
8. Store plates in plastic bags in fridge with your name, date and contents.
