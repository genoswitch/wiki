<b> In this section, you will find all the protocols that we used during our time in the labs! </b>

### Stock solutions for creating competent bacteria

1. LB medium 200 ml in 1L flask (2g Tryptone, 1g Yeast extract, 1g NaCl and H₂O to 200ml). Close with sponge and foil. Label, autoclave at 125°C for 15 minutes and store at room temperature.
2. LB agar 2 x 50ml in 125ml flask: (500mg Tryptone, 250mg Yeast extract, 250mg NaCl, 750mg Agar and H₂O to 50ml). Close with sponge and foil. Label, autoclave at 125°C for 15 minutes and store at room temperature.
3. 0.1 M MgCl₂ solution (2.033 g of MgCl₂·6H₂O in 100ml of H₂O) in 100ml Pyrex bottle. Autoclave and store at 4°C.
4. 0.1 M CaCl₂ solution (11 g of CaCl₂·6H₂O in 500 ml of H₂O) in 500ml Pyrex bottle. Autoclave and store at 4°C.
5. 50% glycerol solution (5ml of glycerol and 5ml H₂O in 20ml) culture tube with screw cup. Autoclave and store at 4°C.

### Pouring agar plates

Wipe down the bench/ working space with 70% Ethanol or bleach.

1. Remove foil cover from LB agar flask but leave sponge.
2. Melt LB agar in microwave and cool to 50°C.
3. Remove 2 sterile Petri dishes from storage.
4. Work under flame.
5. (Optional). If antibiotic is required add solution to the LB agar and mix
6. Pour a layer 25ml of LB agar into each plate, being careful to not lift the cover off excessively.
7. Let each plate to set until its solid (~30 min) then flip so as to avoid condensation on the agar and leave for an additional 30 minutes.
8. Store plates in plastic bags in fridge with your name, date and contents.

### Preparing cell colonies

1.  Work under flame.
2.  Streak 10ml of E. coli cells onto one of the LB agar plates containing no antibiotic or specific for the cell type.
3.  Grow cells overnight at 37°C (plate upside down), no more than 16 hours.
4.  Wrap plate in a parafilm and store at 4°C.

### Determination of bacterial optical density (OD) using the spectrophotometer

These steps should be carried out under the flame with sterile pipette tips to avoid contamination of your sterile media stock and also to protect your cultures from contamination, in case they need to grow longer.

1. Pipette 1ml of your blank, sterile, uninoculated media – the same that is used for the bacterial growth, (LB) into a disposable polystyrene cuvette using sterile technique. Label the cuvette on the frosted portion at the top. Do not touch the lower part of the cuvette with your fingers, as it will interfere with the reading.
2. Using sterile technique, pipet 1 ml of bacterial culture into a labelled cuvette. Replace the foam stopper (sponge) and foil, preparing the culture to go back into the incubator if it needs to grow longer.
3. Take the cuvette to the spectrophotometer.
4. Switch on the spectrophotometer and wait for it to self-calibrate.
5. Check to make sure the wavelength is 600nm. If it is not, click on the wavelength number (nm) and set it to 600 on the number pad window.
6. Put the cuvette into the cuvette holder, blank first. Close the lid.
7. On the spectrophotometers keypad, you will see the word “set ref”. With the cuvette holder in position, press “set ref”. This is giving the spec a baseline absorbance of the LB so it can subtract it from the reading of your bacterial samples.
8. Remove blank cuvette and put your sample cuvette nest. Close the lid and record the OD.
9. If the OD is between 0.4 and 0.6, you may proceed with the induction protocol. If the OD is lower, you will need to put your flask back on the shaker and allow your culture to grow longer.
10. Discard cuvette with blank and your sample safely.
11. When finished with the spec, turn the spectrophotometer off and clean up your bench with 70% ethanol.

### Making competent cells

1. Pick a single colony of the cells from the LB agar plate into 10ml of LB media containing no antibiotic or specific for the cell type. Grow the cultures overnight at 37°C with shaking at 250rpm.
2. Inoculate 200ml of prewarmed to 37°C LB medium (no antibiotics or specific for the cell type) with 10ml of the overnight cultures, and grow at 37°C for 60 minutes, with vigorous shaking 250rpm or until the OD600 is 0.4 - 0.5.
3. Put the flask on ice for 30 minutes. At the same time chill sterile falcon (centrifuge) tubes.
4. Aliquot culture into 50ml each- 4 x 50ml chilled falcon (centrifuge) tubes.
5. Harvest the cells by centrifugation for 7 minutes at 3500rpm, at 4°C and discard supernatants completely.
6. Resuspend cells in each tube in 12.5ml of 0.1 M MgCl₂.
7. Centrifuge for 7 minutes at 3500rpm, at 4°C and discard supernatants.
8. Resuspend cells in each tube in 25ml of 0.1 M CaCl₂.
9. Incubate cells on ice for 30 minutes.
10. Centrifuge for 7 minutes at 3500rpm, at 4°C and discard supernatants.
11. Resuspend cells in each tube in 700µl of 0.1 M CaCl₂ and 300µl of 50% glycerol. Final volume 1ml in each tube.
12. Aliquot 50µl aliquots into 1.5ml sterile microcentrifuge tubes on ice and store at –80°C.

### Conducting gel electrophoresis

Materials:

Gel box  
Gel tray  
Comb - 1% agarose in 1x TAE  
SYBR Safe  
100ml beaker  
Distilled water

Preparing the gel:

1. Prepare 300ml of the TAE buffer by dissolving 6ml of the 50X concentrated buffer in 294ml of distilled water.
2. Add 0.5g of agarose powder into 5ml of the diluted buffer and heat whilst stirring continually until clear.
3. Pour into the gel mould and add the comb with a required number of wells.
4. Pipette in 3µL of SYBR Safe dye and use the pipette tip to mix it around.
5. Mix 3µL of the DNA sample with 2µL of the loading dye.

Running the gel:

1. Add enough 1X TAE to fill the reservoirs at both ends of the gel box and cover the surface of the gel - the gel should be immersed. You should use the remaining TAE buffer from 300ml.
2. Load 1μL prepared ladder (+dye +loading buffer). The concentration is 100μg/ml, i.e. there will be a total of 0.1µg = 100nanograms of ladder in the well. The mass of the ladder is important to know if you need to quantify your bands by comparison with the ladder bands.

Load ladder in left-most lane.

1. use 2 μL loading dye per 3 μL of sample.
2. Load samples from left to right.
3. Place the cover on the gel box such that your samples will run towards the positive, red electrode. Make sure that the cables from the cover are connected to the power supply correctly.
4. Turn on the power supply and run your gel at ~85 V for 80 minutes (voltage and time values can vary). Check regularly to see how far the dye has moved and stop the gel when the dye has moved approximately 80% of the distance.
5. Verify that bubbles are rising from the electrodes once you start your gel to ensure your gel is running properly.
