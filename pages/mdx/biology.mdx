<h2 style={{ paddingTop: 4 }}>Project description</h2>
The project this year has focused on combating the antiquated tests currently in place for diseases
linked to women’s health. Our method involves multiplexed regulation which uses four stacked toehold
switches, for the four diseases, which each test for three miRNA. The switches incorporate genetic
'AND' gates, allowing for high specificity. Uniquely, our project allows for the miRNA binding sites
to be swapped meaning various diseases can be tested for, using the database we have compiled.
<br />
The presence of the miRNA can be tested simultaneously using one blood sample, with the turnaround
time for results being significantly improved compared to older tests. The toehold switches being
used will synthesise different fluorescent proteins, once they have unfolded, given the presence of
the correct miRNA. The chosen fluorescent proteins have varying wavelengths so can be tested
separately, as shown on our <b>

</b>.
<br />
To increase the accessibility of our test, we have chosen to use miRPA to amplify the miRNA taken in
our sample. This allows the miRNA to be isothermally amplified, and therefore doesn’t require the use
of an expensive thermocycler. More information on the probes used can be found on our <b>

Our project uses microRNA biomarkers to indicate the presence of disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are
small, highly conserved non-coding RNA molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression
<Reference number={1} />. These microRNAs circulate in the blood, and can be shown to be either upregulated,
or downregulated in certain conditions. The dysregulation of these diseases can be linked to developmental
stages of diseases
<Reference number={2} />
and by using toehold switches, which have binding sites for the upregulated miRNA we can detect the disease.
While our system is meant to be modular, we have chosen endometriosis, PCOS, ovarian cancer and breast
cancer to prove the theory. Given we needed 3 miRNA for each disease we have chosen the following, which
are all upregulated:
