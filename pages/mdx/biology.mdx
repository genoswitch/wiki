<h2 style={{ paddingTop: 4 }}>Project description</h2>
The project this year has focused on combating the antiquated tests currently in place for diseases
linked to womenâ€™s health. Our method involves multiplexed regulation which uses four stacked toehold
switches, for the four diseases, which each test for three miRNA. The switches incorporate genetic
'AND' gates, allowing for high specificity. Uniquely, our project allows for the miRNA binding sites
to be swapped meaning various diseases can be tested for, using the database we have compiled.
