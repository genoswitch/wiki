<b>Lab Work</b>

In this section, you will find notes from our lab work, which took place over the summer in 2023.

Monday 17th July 2023

Today we delivered the equipment to the lab and started the briefing with Dr Markiv at 10am. This included safety briefing about disposal, gloves and coats, as well as some core skills such as pipetting. We found that in ordering the E.coli, they were not competent cells, as we had planned to use, so we would have to accommodate the new protocols to prepare the E. coli for transformations.

During the day, we prepared the solutions needed to create competent bacteria from ours. This included:

20g/L LB broth x2; 500ml water flask

0.1 M CaCl2 solution (7.35 g of CaCl2·2H2O in 500 ml of H2O) in 500 ml Pyrex bottle. 

0.1 M MgCl2 solution (10.165 g of MgCl2 ·6H2O in 500ml of H2O) in 500ml Pyrex bottle. 

50% glycerol solution (100 ml of glycerol and 100 ml H2O) in 200 ml Pyrex bottle. 

All these soultions would then be autoclaved and stored at 4°C
