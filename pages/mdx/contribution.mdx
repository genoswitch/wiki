<h1>Contribution</h1>

Welcome to the genoswitch wiki! Our Contribution page is a work-in-progress at the moment, but feel free to check out other pages using the navigation bar!

<h2>Parts</h2>
We have developed a number of parts this year, for future teams to use in their projects:
<ContributionParts />

<h2>Collaborative miRNA Database</h2>
We have started a Collaborative miRNA database, which we hope future teams will expand upon, and use
in their future projects using toehold switches and more! You can find our full list below:
<ContributionmiRNADatabase />
