Project GENOSWITCH’s primary aim is to develop a genetic engineering-based cell-free modular test for microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers that can detect cases simultaneously much sooner than current diagnostic methods, so medication can be taken and patients’ symptoms can be tracked by their doctor.

The secondary aim was to create a framework with which researchers and iGEM teams in the future can develop tests for multiple conditions at low miRNA concentrations, and also to develop a comprehensible laymen’s software tool to increase the use of in-silico experimentation, saving costs in the lab.

The final goal was to spread awareness about women’s health and the specific conditions that are associated with it, which, despite their prevalence, are relatively unknown, and too often damages lives in both the developed and less developed worlds.

We will illustrate our modular mechanism using 4 conditions in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, whereby the relevant free-floating miRNAs anneal to the genetically modified composite circuits we have ligated in K12 E. Coli strain.

Each input will correspond to a unique reporter fluorescent protein – namely GFP, mCherry, mCerulean and Venus.

The light expressed would be quantifiably measured using a luminometer - displaying a diagnosis result.

Our mechanism is applicable to all conditions with upregulated sncRNAs or other blood biomarkers in the form of nucleic acids - this is what makes our project modular.

We also have created a simple software tool that will enable potential users to design the relevant composite circuit in-silico without the need for complex coding or thermodynamic calculations.
