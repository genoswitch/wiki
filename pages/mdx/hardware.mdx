#### Extraction of miRNA

In project Genoswitch, we have decided to use novel methods of electrochemical detection and extraction of miRNA particles in order to achieve our projectsâ€™ goals of creating a system that is both robust and flexible. After our research<Reference number={1}/>, we decided to use an extraction method involving electromagnetic nanoparticles since we felt that it was a cheaper alternative to PCR, but was nonetheless effective for our needs. It is a multi-stage process which involves the following:
Samples of blood are taken from a patient and added to a solution containing magnetic nanoparticles. These nanoparticles often consist of a metal (usually iron) oxide and are also coated with a biotin-streptavidin bonded anti-miRNA strand.
A set of electromagnets is turned on and off in quick succession, causing the nanoparticles to move and stir the solution.
During this process, target miRNAs bond to the complementary anti-miRNA via base-pairing.
Afterwards, the magnetic beads are pulled to the side of the container while the rest of the solution is removed.
The miRNA is removed from the beads using an elution buffer.
The previous steps are repeated three times in order to remove the maximum possible amount of miRNA for amplification.

Amplification of miRNA is discussed more here (add link to bio page on RPA amplification).

#### Testing the Luminometer

After speaking with our head of Physics, we decided that there should be three main experiments to tests the efficacy of our luminometer:

- A first test with a simple light source without any colour filters in order to check that all the LDRs were working correctly.

- A second test with colour filters and a U.V. lamp to check that any visible light emitted by U.V. lamps would not give false positive results.

- A final test using the mCherry protein (which has the lowest fluorescent quantum yield of the four reporter proteins we are using), in order to determine the sufficient amount of toehold switches that would be needed for clear results.
