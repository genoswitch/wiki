# Human Practices

Welcome to the genoswitch wiki! Our Human Practices page is a work-in-progress at the moment, but feel free to check out other pages using the navigation bar!

## Project Impact

We hope that our project can drastically decrease the time between symptoms arising, and a diagnosis of diseases such as endometriosis, PCOS, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer, at a fraction of the cost of current diagnostic methods. At present, many patients struggle to get a diagnosis for these conditions, having to struggle to convince medical professionals that the symptoms that they face are real. By producing a more efficient tool for diagnosis, we hope that the unnecessary suffering that patients go through whilst waiting for a diagnosis would be minimised.

We also hope that by increasing education in these diseases, as if more people are aware of symptoms of diseases, understanding of these conditions will increase. As a result, we have led sessions for pupils in CLS, CLSG, and a session with the year 6 cohort of City Junior School, with the hope of further educating young people on these diseases, to help them in the future. Our sessions also had the aim of teaching pupils about Genetic Engineering, hopefully inspiring them to do further research into the field, and be members of the City of London UK teams in the future.

We envision that our tool would be used by phlebotomy departments in Integrated Care Systems in the NHS, to test blood samples of patients in the early stages of a referral to a secondary healthcare, or patients who have been referred to the department to form the basis of a preliminary diagnosis of PCOS, Endometriosis, Cervical Cancer & Breast Cancer. This would be done through the use of a blood test (which can be done in GP Surgeries, before being sent to the lab, or in the department itself), a sample can be taken and miRNA can be detected using our tool. As a result, a preliminary diagnosis for endometriosis, PCOS, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer can be given, to more quickly provide grounds for referrals to more specialised tests to confirm the diagnosis. We believe that by using our tool, a diagnosis of these diseases can occur more rapidly, easily, and cost-effectively, ultimately decreasing the level of suffering of patients awaiting a diagnosis.
