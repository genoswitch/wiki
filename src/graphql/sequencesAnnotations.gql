# Define (override the auto-generated) the type for SequencesYamlAnnotations

# Opt out of type inferrance using @dontInfer
# (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/schema-customization/#opting-out-of-type-inference)
# This means we must explicitly provide typedefs for each field.
# The effect of this is that extra keys will be ignored by GraphQL.

type SequencesYamlAnnotations implements Node @dontInfer {
	# Non-nullable fields
	name: String!
	start: Int!
	end: Int!
	direction: Int! # TODO: 0 or 1
	color: String! # TODO: are there fixed colors in SeqViz?
